# docker assignments for the tooling deep-dive

the [tooling deep dive](https://www.facebook.com/events/1705620649739179/) is a bootcamp organized by [Hack & SÃ¶hne](https://hackundsoehne.de). 

## 1. Installing docker

First we need to install [docker community edition](https://www.docker.com/community-edition). You can get docker CE for your OS here: https://store.docker.com/search?type=edition&offering=community

## 2. A first step using docker

First run `docker pull hello-world`, this will download the latest hello-world image.
To actually run the image type `docker run hello-world`, this should verify that everything is set up correctly.
(you may want to delete the container AND the image! HINT).

## 3. Your first assignment

Pull the ubuntu (ubuntu:latest) image and run `docker run --name ubuntu-test -i -t ubuntu bash`. You are now running bash inside the ubuntu image, explore the image (if you are feeling adventurous you can delete important files!).
Explanation of the command: `docker run` starts the image, `--name ubuntu-test` names the container ubuntu-test and `-i -t` allocates an interactive pseudo TTY.
To exit, type `exit` (you may want to delete the container AND the image).

## 4. Running a webserver with docker

The image `prakhar1989/static-site` provides a static website hostet by nginx.
You need to (Hints):
 - pull the image
 - run the image (NOT interactive, in the background and with ports exposed)
 - verify it is running by opening `localhost:port` in the browser (if not specified `docker ports X` shows you the ports the container is mapped to. Also if you are running docker in a vm check the ip of the VM via `docker-machine ip` and need to visit `ip:port`)
 - stop the container
 - delete the comtainer
